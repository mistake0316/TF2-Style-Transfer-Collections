# TF2-Style-Transfer-Collections
Plenty of old sytle transfer methods' github repo did not implement by tensorflow 2.
Thus I am trying to implement them with tf.keras, tensorflow 2 for understand style transfer & tf2.<br>
Now I am BFS from [Neural Style Transfer: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04058)<br>
I will also try to insert some extension in these methods.<br>

I hope the viewers can also share some good paper to me :)
